About the module
================

The Data Import module provides a method for collecting various
project details from external sources and import them into
dotProject.  It is designed to be extensible and configurable
and provides for user-definable import options.

Installation
============

As with all dotproject modules, unpack the archive and move
the dataimport directory and all of its contents (including
subdirectories) to the modules directory of your dotProject
installation.  This should result in a directory called
dotproject/modules/dataimport.

Then log in to dotProject as a system administrator and in
System Admin, choose View Modules.  Somewhere near the bottom
of the list you should find the dataimport module.  Select
install, then click on the 'disabled' message to enable it.
You can also add it to the list of modules in the top navigation
bar by selecting the 'hidden' option.

Usage
=====

Select the Data Import module from the top navigation bar.
This will display an import data form that asks a number of
questions.  If this is the first time through, you will be
asked for details of the upload file format and the data
mapping.  This can then be saved so that on future imports
you can select this configuration, or set this to the
default configuration.

Select Import Configuration
